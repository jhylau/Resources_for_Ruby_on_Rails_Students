How to learn web development
======================

Throughout the pass few months, I have come across a ton of resource for learning full-stack web development... Some were great, some were not so great.  Hopefully by sharing with you my favorite resources, I can help you on your way to becoming an awesome web developer.  

Please feel free to fork this and make edits!

Learning HTML/CSS
======================
1) TeamTreehouse 

If you enjoy visual, video learning (which I do), they have some decent videos for HTML and CSS.  It's a good start for a beginner, but by no means comprehensive.  It will get you used to the syntax and help you jumpstart your learning.

2) Twitter Bootstrap (front-end framework)

If you want rapid development, check this front-end framework out.  Their grid system and default designs will help you get started.  Customizing their designs may take some work, but I like this tool for rapidly prototyping. They have great documentation and support as well.

Learning Ruby
======================
1) Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

An amazingly well-written book on important OOP design priciples.  Suitable for intermediate to advanced rubyists.  Complete with code examples, detailed discussion, and very easy to read.  I highly recommend this for ANYONE learning ruby.  A must read.

Learning Rails
======================
1) Hartl's Tutorial

Cheat Sheets
